Full repository for the Unimi Deep Learning course. 

## 1-Introduction to Python

Basic python: functions and classes


## 2-Libraries for Data Science

Introduction to: Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and TensorFlow

## 3-Custom models

Sequential models creation from basic linear algebra

## 4-Regression and Classification Models

Use of keras to perform a regression on a set of points and a classification between images of clothes

## 5-Hyperparameters tuning

Use of Hyperopt to perform a hyperparameter search.

## 6-Callbacks and RNNs

Use of callbacks to stop the training process and avoid overfitting.

Use of LSTM to forecast daily temperature.
